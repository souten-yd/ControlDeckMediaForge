# Media Forge implementation status

Date: 2026-08-21
Scope: MF0-0 and MF0-1 (`docs/implementation/mf0-addon-core.md`)
Repository head at start: `770383a` (`origin/main`)

## MF0-0 — COMPLETE for the requested environment slice

The core service, heavyweight ROCm runtime, caches, and persistent Media Forge data are separated. Section 10 was executed from retreated `.venv` / runtime state on the target host. This status uses runtime observations; lint, syntax checks, and unit tests are not counted as proof that the environments work.

## MF0-1 — COMPLETE

The loopback service skeleton, Add-on v2 manifest, schema serving, four-state health contract, contribution-level availability, and setup snapshot integration are implemented. Unfinished execution contributions fail closed with explicit reasons and actions; no fake job runner or later MF0 behavior is claimed in this slice.

Real-process verification on 2026-08-21:

```text
ControlDeck ./deck.sh ext lint: valid=true, warnings=0
healthy health:        HTTP 200, 0.001353 sec
degraded health:       HTTP 200, 0.000551 sec
unavailable health:    HTTP 200, 0.000397 sec
setup_required health: HTTP 200, 0.000414 sec
schema response:       HTTP 200, 0.003092 sec
placeholder response:  HTTP 200, 178 bytes
```

For all four health states, `navigation:workspace=available` remained stable while `workflow_executor:media.generate=unavailable`. The manual health switch returned 404 unless `MEDIA_FORGE_ENABLE_TEST_ENDPOINTS=1`.

The final default process returned `setup_required` in 0.001575 seconds with a 2373-byte response. Core/runtime/GPU setup items were `ok`, model library was `missing`, and the disabled test switch returned HTTP 404.

## Implemented artifacts

- `mf.sh`: non-root guard; Python 3.11+ check; independent data directory; shared cache discovery; stamp-based core/runtime creation; broken-venv rebuild; doctor/build/list/prune/test/serve commands; disk preflight; real ROCm tensor verification; cheap health snapshot generation.
- `requirements.txt`: lightweight core dependencies only. Importing `torch` in the final core environment exits 1 with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- `runtimes/rocm-torch/`: ROCm 7.2.1 PyTorch 2.10 requirements, size/download metadata, and `.refs` containing `image`. The runtime environment is not shared with core or ControlDeck.
- `config/config.yaml`: Media Forge data defaults to `~/.local/share/control-deck-media-forge`; model libraries remain explicitly unset; `auto_provision=true` starts a visible, locked background runtime build when the environment is missing.
- Environment health is read from `config/environment-status.json`, an ignored snapshot written outside the request handler. Missing/invalid snapshots fail closed as `setup_required`.

### 1–4. Retreated state, doctor, cold core start, and health

Both Media Forge venvs were absent for the initial check. `./mf.sh doctor` reported `core_env=missing`, `rocm_runtime=missing`, `model_library=missing`, and both ROCm tools. It selected these shared paths:

```text
PIP_CACHE_DIR=/data1tb/ControlDeck/data/cache/pip
UV_CACHE_DIR=/data1tb/ControlDeck/data/cache/uv
HF_HOME=/data1tb/ControlDeck/data/cache/huggingface
```

Tree hashes before and after the clean `doctor` call were identical:

```text
Media Forge: 35949df532f0149d45eb66f81e7e4dc0622417e95e62b00cedd86cd10324c156
ControlDeck:  8bf954ab6dbce61bd79e58543010ee800825364d6313b74008a89ff006ed5842
```

`./mf.sh serve` created the core environment and served real HTTP in 5.835 seconds. Its cold size was 115724645 bytes. `GET /health` returned HTTP 200 with `status=setup_required`, `rocm_runtime=missing`, and `gpu=checking`.

After the final implementation, a missing runtime stamp was exercised again with automatic provisioning disabled. The real health response included the measured/index-derived estimate:

```text
rocm_runtime.state=missing
rocm_runtime.message="Run ./mf.sh env build rocm-torch; estimated download 2100000000 bytes"
gpu.state=checking
```

### 5–6. Clean runtime construction and actual GPU execution

Before download, `./mf.sh env build rocm-torch` displayed:

```text
runtime=ROCm 7.2.1 PyTorch 2.10 runtime
estimated_download=2100000000 bytes
available=809378115584 bytes
required_with_headroom=8589934592 bytes
```

From runtime-venv creation to installed Torch metadata was 225 seconds. From creation to the final successful GPU snapshot was 264 seconds. The latter includes correction and reruns described below. Final runtime size was 4445904539 bytes. The shared pip cache gained 45 files / 1956470511 bytes.

The first construction attempt installed the packages and then exposed a `set -u` wrapper defect (`snapshot: unbound variable`). That defect was fixed rather than recorded as success. PyTorch then warned that NumPy was absent; NumPy was added to the runtime requirements and the clean final GPU check was rerun.

The final real GPU operation produced:

```json
{
  "torch_version": "2.10.0+rocm7.2.1.gitb07cec22",
  "hip_version": "7.2.53211",
  "device_count": 2,
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700",
      "gcn_arch": "gfx1201",
      "total_memory_bytes": 34208743424
    },
    {
      "name": "AMD Radeon Graphics",
      "gcn_arch": "gfx1036",
      "total_memory_bytes": 16302784512
    }
  ],
  "selected_device": 0,
  "free_memory_bytes": 33975959552,
  "total_memory_bytes": 34208743424,
  "tensor_result": 16773120.0,
  "elapsed_sec": 0.05090730299707502
}
```

The second device's memory value is the value reported by Torch. `rocm-smi` separately reported a 536870912-byte iGPU VRAM aperture; no inference was made to reconcile those two interfaces.

### 7–10. Warm start, stamps, inventory, and prune safety

- Warm `./mf.sh serve` logged `core requirements unchanged; skipping pip` and reached HTTP readiness in 0.277 seconds.
- A real health request took 0.001537 seconds; repeated requests were 0.001487 and 0.001473 seconds, all below the three-second contract.
- Adding one line to top-level `requirements.txt` caused the next start to log `installing core dependencies`. Restoring the final file caused one final install, and `.venv/.req-stamp` exactly matched the final requirements SHA-256 `875d8f1916f28b5f0e3f98c0302a3664ae21e9a1e671ee1512ab24881fa0ca40`.
- A deliberately non-executable/missing core `bin/python` was detected as broken. `mf.sh` removed only the approved core venv path, rebuilt it, and the resulting real service returned HTTP 200 in 0.001473 seconds.
- With `auto_provision=true` and the runtime stamp retreated, `mf.sh serve` logged the runtime name, 2100000000-byte estimate, 802764632064-byte capacity result, and started a lock-protected background build. It restored the stamp, reran the real GPU operation, and reported a zero-byte pip-cache delta. With `auto_provision=false`, the same missing-stamp setup did not build, remained `setup_required`, and exposed the manual build action.
- Final `./mf.sh env list` output:

```text
core       state=current size_bytes=116345980 refs=-
rocm-torch state=current size_bytes=4445904539 refs=image
```

- `./mf.sh env prune` printed `keeping rocm-torch: referenced by image`; size remained 4445904539 bytes. Core was never a prune candidate.
- With a temporary required capacity of 9999999999999 bytes, build exited 1 before installation, reported the actual 802764906496 bytes available, preserved runtime size and stamp, and exposed `rocm_runtime.state=error` in the health snapshot. The committed requirement was restored to 8589934592 bytes.

### 11. Shared cache evidence

The runtime used ControlDeck's configured cache root without importing or executing ControlDeck code. The two largest downloaded wheels were present in that shared pip cache:

```text
torch body:  1645259227 bytes, mtime 2026-08-21 08:00:13.355694214 +0900
triton body:  301690151 bytes, mtime 2026-08-21 08:00:44.899307331 +0900
pip cache:   2369228186 bytes total after the run
HF_HOME:     /data1tb/ControlDeck/data/cache/huggingface
HF dir mtime: 2026-08-18 08:13:25.254909152 +0900
```

No model was downloaded in MF0-0, so `HF_HOME` contained no new file and its mtime did not change. Model-cache reuse is therefore NOT TESTED rather than inferred. A warm runtime rebuild reported `pip cache delta: 0 bytes`.

Explicit user cache values were preserved exactly. Running doctor with `/tmp/mf00-user-{pip,uv,hf}` values printed those same paths and did not create them. With all cache variables unset and an unreadable ControlDeck config, doctor warned and selected Media Forge's own `data_dir/cache/{pip,uv,huggingface}` paths.

### 12. Persistent-data independence

No data was deleted. Canonical paths and filesystems were observed as:

```text
Media Forge: /home/souten/.local/share/control-deck-media-forge
             /dev/sda2, device 2050
ControlDeck: /data1tb/ControlDeck/data
             /dev/nvme0n1p1, device 66305
media_inside_controldeck=no
controldeck_inside_media=no
```

The Media Forge path still contained `media-forge.sqlite3`, `assets/`, and `work/`. Thus deleting either configured tree cannot select the other tree by containment. This is the requested non-destructive path proof; actual deletion was intentionally not performed.

## Additional behavior checks

- Temporarily removing the GPU snapshot left the real core service running. Health returned HTTP 200 / `setup_required`, with `gpu.state=checking`; restoring and rerunning the GPU check returned it to `ok`.
- Final focused `./mf.sh test`: 9 passed in 0.16 seconds with one upstream Starlette/httpx deprecation warning. This is regression evidence only, not runtime proof.
- `bash -n mf.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. These are static checks only.
- Final ControlDeck checkout observation: HEAD `9272c05`, clean `git status --short`. It was read-only throughout this slice; no ControlDeck file was modified.

## NOT TESTED / intentionally deferred

- Worker-pack enable/disable mutation of `.refs`: no worker-pack lifecycle is present yet. The current non-empty reference and prune protection were tested.
- Installed ControlDeck setup checklist and enable/disable browser flow: deferred to MF0-7. The real Media Forge HTTP payload and ControlDeck's real manifest linter were tested.
- Hugging Face model download/cache reuse: no model adoption or weights belong to MF0-0.
- Model library configuration: deliberately remains `missing`; selecting and benchmarking a model belongs to G1.

## Scope boundary

No model, Diffusers adapter, job runner, fake worker, asset store, embedded workspace, host token/lease/jobs bridge, or MF0-2+ execution feature is included. The ROCm runtime check is environment qualification only and is not a model benchmark or a G1 implementation.
